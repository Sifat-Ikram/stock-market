# ReactJS and NodeJs CRUD Application

## Project Overview

This project is a demonstration of building a simple web application using ReactJS for the frontend and NodeJs (ExpressJs) for the backend. The application showcases CRUD operations, data visualization, and deployment in a cloud hosting service, Firebase.

## Features

1. **Table Visualization**:
   - Displays data from a JSON file in a table format on the homepage.

2. **Editable Table with SQL Backend**:
   - Data is loaded into an SQL server.
   - Table rows are editable, demonstrating CRUD operations.

3. **Line and Bar Chart**:
   - A line chart showing the 'close' column against the date.
   - A bar chart showing the 'volume' column.
   - A dropdown to filter data by `trade_code`.

4. **Additional Visualization**:
   - Additional creative visualizations to enhance data insights.

Although the backend of this project should be in Python but I have developed backend in NodeJs with expressJs and Nosql database MongoDB. I am willing to learn Python in this internship.
